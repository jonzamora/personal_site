<p><img class="profile-picture" src="profile_photo.jpg" /></p>

<p>Hello! I am a second-year student pursuing a <em>[B.S. in Computer Science]</em> and a <em>[B.S. in Mathematics-Probability and Statistics]</em> at {TBD}.</p>

<h2 id="research-interests">Research Interests</h2>

<p>I am interested in the intersection of Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Healthcare Applications.
Currently, I am conducting research on Epileptic Seizures with applications to Logistic Regression and Machine Learning 
through Google &amp; the University of California, San Diego’s ExploreCSR [Explore Computer Science] Research Program.</p>

<p>This Summer, I will be an undergraduate research intern at the Mesirov Lab [University of California, San Diego: School of Medicine].
Here, I plan to conduct algorithmic research on Cancer Genomics.</p>
