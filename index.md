## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile_photo.jpg">

Hello! I am a second-year student pursuing a *[B.S. in Computer Science]* and a *[B.S. in Mathematics-Probability and Statistics]* at {TBD}.

## Research Interests

I am interested in the intersection of Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Healthcare Applications.
Currently, I am conducting research on Epileptic Seizures with applications to Logistic Regression and Machine Learning 
through Google & the University of California, San Diego's ExploreCSR [Explore Computer Science] Research Program.

This Summer, I will be an undergraduate research intern at the Mesirov Lab [University of California, San Diego: School of Medicine].
Here, I plan to conduct algorithmic research on Cancer Genomics.
